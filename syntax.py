"""
Associate syntactic elements like "*" recognized
by the parser with semantic classes like TIMES in
the expr module.

We limit the definitions here to binary (TIMES, PLUS,
etc) and unary (NEG) operators, whose lexical
representations are literal strings like *, +, and ~.
Patterns for numeric constants and identifiers are
built into the lexical analyzer and not defined
here to avoid regular expression hell. Take CIS 461
if you want to learn a more general way to do this.
